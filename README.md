BrokenSea is a simulation of a NFT marketplace where different individuals come together and trade their NFTs. After a visitor registers an account and logs in, they can perform different actions which include minting their own NFT collection as a creator and putting them up for sale on the marketplace. Other traditional actions include listing, buying, selling, or even burning their NFTs.
